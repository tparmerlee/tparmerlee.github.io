### Privacy Policy (simplified)

The purpose of this privacy policy is to provide maximum transparency regarding the information the site collects and how it is used.

In compliance with the obligations arising from **United States Data Privacy Laws**, this site respects and protects the privacy of its visitors and users, making every possible and proportionate effort to avoid infringing their rights.

This site does not publish advertisements or use data for advertising purposes. However, it uses third-party services to improve the usability of the site. These third parties may collect user data and then use it to send personalized ads on other sites. However, this site makes every effort to protect user privacy and minimize the collection of personal data. For example:

- posting comments via a third-party service (Disqus). Disqus specifically requests consent when a comment is posted, providing its own privacy policy. At that point, the user can determine how their data will be processed by Disqus. This site does not process the aforementioned data in any way.

For further information, please read the full policy below.

### Privacy Policy (complete)

<br>

### Legal Basis of the Processing

This site processes data primarily based on user consent. Consent is provided via the banner at the bottom of the page, or through use or browsing of the site, as a conclusive action. By using or browsing the site, visitors and users approve this privacy policy and consent to the processing of their personal data in relation to the methods and purposes described below, including any disclosure to third parties if necessary for the provision of a service (e.g., comments box). Further consent is collected through the communication or service request forms, relating to the specific purpose of the service.

<i class="fa fa-info-circle fa-3x fa-pull-left" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #337ab7;"></i> Providing data and therefore consenting to data collection and processing is optional. Users may refuse consent, and may revoke consent already given at any time (via the banner at the bottom of the page, their browser's cookie settings, or the Contact link). However, denying consent may make it impossible to provide certain services, and the site's browsing experience may be compromised.

The data collected for site security, abuse prevention, and statistics purposes are processed based on the data controller's legitimate interests.

<br/>

### Purpose of the Processing

The processing of data collected by the site, in addition to the purposes related, instrumental, and necessary to providing the service, is aimed at the following purposes:

- **Statistics (Analysis)**<br>
Collection of data and information in an exclusively aggregated and anonymous form to verify the proper functioning of the site. None of this information is related to the individual user of the site, and does not allow identification in any way.

- **Security**<br>
Data and information are collected to protect the security of the site (spam filters, firewalls, virus detection) and its users, and to prevent or detect fraud or abuse of the website. The data is recorded automatically and may also include personal data (IP address), which may be used, in accordance with applicable laws, to block attempts to damage the site or other users, or otherwise engage in harmful or criminal activities. This data is never used to identify or profile users and is deleted periodically.

- **Ancillary Activities**<br>
Disclose data to third parties who perform functions necessary or instrumental to the operation of the service (e.g., comment boxes), and to allow third parties to perform technical, logistical, and other activities on our behalf. Suppliers have access only to the personal data necessary to perform their tasks and undertake not to use the data for other purposes. They are required to process personal data in accordance with applicable regulations.
 
<br />

### Data Collected

This site collects user data in two ways.

<i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o fa-3x fa-pull-left" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #337ab7;"></i> **Data collected automatically**<br>
During User navigation, the following information may be collected and stored in the site's server (hosting) log files:

- Internet Protocol (IP) address
- Browser type
- Device parameters used to connect to the site
- Name of the Internet Service Provider (ISP)
- Date and time of visit
- Visitor's referral and exit web page
- Possibly the number of clicks

This data is not available in any way and remains the exclusive management of the provider of this web space (GitHub.com)

<i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o fa-3x fa-pull-left" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #337ab7;"></i> **Data Voluntarily provided**

The site may collect other data when users voluntarily use services, such as commenting and communication services (contact forms, comment boxes), and these data will be used exclusively to provide the requested service:

- name
- email address

Comments are managed through an external service (Disqus), for which please refer to the service's policies for further information (see the cookies section).
 
<br>

### Location of Processing

The data collected by the site is processed at the Data Controller's headquarters and at the web hosting provider's data center. The web hosting provider (GitHub - USA), which is responsible for data processing on behalf of the data controller, is located in the United States of America and operates in complience with U.S. Law.

<br>

### Data Retention Period
The data collected by the site during its operation is retained for the time strictly necessary to carry out the specified activities. Upon expiration, the data will be deleted or anonymized, unless there are other purposes for its retention.

The data (IP address) used for site security purposes (blocking attempts to damage the site) is retained for 7 days.

<br>

### Transfer of Collected Data to Third Parties

The data collected by the site is generally not disclosed to third parties, except in specific cases: legitimate request by judicial authorities and only in cases provided for by law; when necessary to provide a specific service requested by the User; or to perform security checks or optimize the site.

### Cookies

Cookies are text files that are stored on the user's terminal or that allow access to information on the user's terminal. Cookies allow us to store information about visitor preferences. They are used to verify the proper functioning of the site and improve its functionality by customizing page content based on the browser used, or to simplify navigation by automating procedures (e.g., login, site language), and finally to analyze visitor use of the site.

This site uses the following categories of cookies:

- **Technical Cookies**, used for the sole purpose of transmitting electronic communications, to ensure the correct display of the site and navigation within it. Some of these cookies are deleted when the browser is closed (session cookies), others have a longer duration (such as the cookie required to retain the user's consent to the use of cookies, which lasts **1 month**). Consent is not required for these cookies;

- **Preferences**, which allow the website to store information that influences its behavior or appearance, such as your preferred language or location. These are also necessary for the site to function and are therefore similar to technical cookies.

<i class="fa fa-info-circle fa-3x fa-pull-left" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #337ab7;"></i> By clicking OK on the banner displayed upon first accessing the site or by browsing the site, the visitor expressly consents to the use of cookies and similar technologies, and in particular to the storage of such cookies on their device for the purposes indicated above, or to accessing information on their device via cookies.

<br>

### Disabling Cookies

The user can refuse the use of cookies and can revoke any consent already given at any time. Since cookies are linked to the browser used, **THEY CAN BE DISABLED DIRECTLY FROM THE BROWSER**.

<i class="fa fa-info-circle fa-3x fa-pull-left" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #337ab7;"></i> DISABLING COOKIES MAY PREVENT THE CORRECT USE OF SOME FUNCTIONS OF THE SITE. In particular, third-party services may not be accessible and therefore may not be viewable:

- YouTube videos or other video sharing services
- Social network sharing features
- Disqus comments

Instructions for disabling cookies, and for deleting cookies already present on the user's device, can be found on the following web pages:

### Third-party Cookies
This site also acts as an intermediary for third-party cookies (such as social media buttons), used to provide additional services and features to visitors and to simplify the use of the site, or to provide personalized advertising. This site has no control over their cookies, which are entirely managed by third parties, and does not have access to the information collected through these cookies. Information on the use of these cookies and their purposes, as well as how to disable them, is provided directly by the third parties on the pages listed below.

Please note that user tracking generally does not identify the user, unless the user is already registered for the service and is also logged in, in which case it is assumed that the user has already given their consent directly to the third party when registering for the relevant service (e.g., Facebook).

This site uses cookies from the following third parties:

* **Disqus**: allows you to post comments on the site and create links between comments, even across different sites. When you visit a page on this website that contains a Disqus comment box, your browser connects directly to the Disqus servers where the box is loaded. You can post a comment by connecting to your Disqus account, in which case Disqus collects information about your visits to this and other sites and can link your online movements directly to your personal profile. If you also consent to sharing data with third parties, Disqus will use it to provide you with personalized advertising.<br>
However, you may opt out of personalized content. You can also comment by entering only your name and email address, without connecting to an account. <br><br>
<i class="fa fa-info-circle fa-3x fa-pull-left" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #337ab7;"></i> **Disqus is the independent data controller** and provides its own specific privacy policy with details on its data processing.
If you do not want Disqus to record data relating to your visit to our website and your online behavior, you must log out of your Disqus account and, likely, delete the cookies Disqus has installed in your browser.
Data collected: number and behavior of users, IP address, browser ID, and the website that incorporates the comment box. <br />
Place of data processing: USA<br />
**You may selectively opt out of Disqus collecting personal data** on the [opt-out](https://disqus.com/data-sharing-settings/) page.

<hr> 

### Security Measures

We process visitor/user data lawfully and correctly, adopting appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or destruction of data. We are committed to protecting the security of your personal data during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information in transit. Processing is carried out using computerized and/or electronic means, with organizational methods and logic strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the Data Controller, in some cases, categories of persons involved in the organization of the site or external parties (such as third-party technical service providers, hosting providers) may have access to the data.

<br> 

### User Rights

Pursuant to United States Data Privacy Laws, the data subject may, in accordance with the procedures and within the limits established by current legislation, exercise the following rights:

- right of access: request confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her is being processed, and to receive information on the methods and purposes of the processing, as well as the right to receive a copy of the data provided, within reasonable limits;
- right to withdraw consent granted at any time without having to provide a reason, but without prejudice to processing carried out up to that point;
- right to request the updating, rectification, or integration of incomplete or inaccurate data;
- the right to object, in whole or in part, to processing based on the data controller's legitimate interests, unless there is a legitimate reason to continue processing, such as the exercise of legal claims;
- the right to object to the processing of personal data for marketing or commercial communication purposes;
- the right to erasure of data (even after withdrawing consent), if the data is no longer necessary for the purposes of the data controller, if consent is withdrawn, if the data subject objects to processing, if the processing violates the law, or if there is a legal obligation to erase the data;
- the right to restriction of processing, i.e., to obtain the blocking of processing in the event of a breach of the lawfulness of processing, but also if the data subject requests rectification of the data (pending rectification) or objects to its processing (pending the data controller's decision), in which case the data will not be processed except for storage;
- right to **data portability**, meaning, in cases of consent-based processing, the right to receive or transmit to another designated data controller, at the sole cost of any media, the data provided to the Data Controller, in a structured and machine-readable format and in a format commonly used by an electronic device;
- as well as, more generally, to exercise all the rights granted to you by applicable law.

To exercise these rights, it may be necessary to provide documentation identifying the User (copy of an identity document), to certify the legitimacy of the request and prevent data from falling into the wrong hands. The deadline for responding to requests is 30 days, which may be extended for an additional 30 days in special cases.

Requests must be forwarded to the Data Controller.
